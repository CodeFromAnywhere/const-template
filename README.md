# const-template

The idea of a const template would be to create a unchangeable definition of a company or principle.

Locking the repo to 'archived' makes it unchangeable which is good for things like a constitution. They must be made unchangeable. But since archived repos can still be unarchived, it must be able to be 'locked' too. It must not be possible to be deleted, altered, or move in any way.

We can probably uphold this in a decentralised network of trustful nodes that 'remember' these constant definitions and tell each other the truth.

For now, an archived repo will be sufficient, as for a centralised system, we trust the creator anyway...
